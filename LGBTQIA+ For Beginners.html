<h1>My Experience</h1>
	<p>I am a long standing member of the LGBTQIA+ community, and if you don’t understand what that acronym means, then don’t worry, as I will explain shortly. This website is designed to give people a basic understanding of how the LGBTQIA+ community works, and to spread awareness.</p>

<h2>What is the LGBTQIA+ Community?</h2>
	<p>The LGBTQIA+ community is an acronym that stands for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Aromantic/Asexual. The LGBTQIA+ community is not limited to people who fall under these categories, as people may be multiple of these, or even something else not listed, which is very common. The LGBTQIA+ community is <em>very</em> expansive, and don’t worry if you don’t know what any of these terms mean yet, as I can explain. To begin, let’s start with the 3 main categories of terms that are important in the LGBTQIA+ community: Sexualities, Genders and Pronouns/Names.</p>
<h3>Sexualities</h3>
	<p>A person’s sexuality is essentially who they are attracted to, both romantically and sexually. Someone may be attracted to just males, maybe just females, or even both. And there’s more sexualities than just these 3. I could go on and on about how many there are, but if you would like to see more, then <a href=”(placeholder link)”>linked to this text is a small list of the most common sexualities along with their pride flags.</a> A pride flag is essentially the LGBTQIA+ community way to represent sexualities, genders, and more. The one you probably know best is the rainbow flag. Each pride flag has its own selected colors to represent the attributes of whatever the flag is tied to. They’re specifically called pride flags because they give people in the LGBTQIA+ community a sense of pride in their sexuality, gender, pronouns, etc.</p>
<h3>Genders</h3>
	<p>In the LGBTQIA+ community, genders aren’t just limited to the 2 we know, male and female. Gender as we know it in the LGBTQIA+ community is linked to however the individual person feels about themselves inside. Most people are happy with their gender they were born with, but some people, such as myself, don’t feel comfortable with their birth gender. Some people may be born as a male, but feel more comfortable seeing themselves as female, and vice versa as well. I am part of this group known as transgender. People who are transgender go from one gender to the other, while still staying in the 2 binary genders that are commonly known. When someone doesn’t feel like they belong in either of the 2 binary genders, and choose to be associated outside of that, they are called non-binary. They aren’t part of the 2 genders, not here nor there. The truth is that some people don’t feel comfortable with what they were born as, and they will feel happier if they present themselves differently. Like with the sexualities section, <a href=”Genders Code.html”>tied to this text is a link of the more common genders in the LGBTQIA+ community, along with their pride flags</a> and you can go back to check what I mean by pride flags if you missed it.</p>
<h3>Pronouns/Names</h3>
	<p>When people change their gender and become transgender, non-binary, etc, they commonly change their name and pronouns with it. To explain, names and pronouns both carry certain gender connotations with them. For example, pronouns he, him, and so on have a male connotation, and the same with she, her, and so on. Commonly pronouns are shortened when explaining what pronouns you use. For male pronouns, people generally say he/him to explain it. And with female pronouns, it’s she/her. This also goes for they/them pronouns, as they are carry no true gender connotation with them. That’s why non-binary people usually use they/them, as it won’t make them feel like they’re still stuck in the binary. In the next section I go into more detail about what this means, and why pronouns/names matter so much. Similar things go for names with pronouns, as many names are commonly associated with males or females, and sometimes people would prefer to avoid that association. That’s why people such as myself have changed their pronouns and names to make us feel more comfortable.</p>
<h3>Why do pronouns and names matter so much to people?</h3>
	<p>To explain this, there is one major factor at play: Gender Dysphoria, as it’s medically known. It basically just means that people with gender dysphoria don’t feel comfortable with their gender, pronouns, name, whatever, but most commonly the gender. It’s the driving force for why people change their gender, as people with gender dysphoria feel really uncomfortable being associated with a certain binary gender. When people get to express themselves as who they want to be, it really alieviates the problems of gender dysphoria, and it’s best described as this warm, comforting feeling washing away the gender dysphoria.</p>
